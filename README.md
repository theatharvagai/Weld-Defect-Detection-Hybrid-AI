# 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a novel **Hybrid AI Framework** for automated weld defect detection in industrial environments, integrating:

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data balancing
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction
* XGBoost for high-accuracy classification

The proposed system addresses class imbalance in defect datasets and significantly improves detection accuracy and robustness in real-world industrial inspection scenarios.

# 🧠 Core Innovation

Unlike traditional single-model approaches, this research introduces a **hybrid pipeline** that:

* Uses GAN to generate synthetic defect samples
* Enhances dataset balance and diversity
* Extracts deep features using CNN
* Applies XGBoost for optimized classification

This hybrid architecture achieves superior performance in complex weld defect detection tasks.
